# kerTests

This repository provides the _R_ functions for the paper: 

**Song, H.**, Chen, H.    \
  [Generalized kernel two-sample tests.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06127.pdf) \
  _under review_ &ensp; [R package: [kerTests](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kerTests/index.html)]
  
* We propose a new test statistic that makes use of a common pattern under moderate and high dimensions and achieves substantial power improvements over existing kernel two-sample tests for a wide range of alternatives. We also propose alternative testing procedures that maintain high power with low computational cost, offering easy off-the-shelf tools for large datasets.

* The main function can also be provided in an _R_ package [kerTests](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kerTests/index.html) on _CRAN_.

* We introduce the usage of the `kertests()` function and demonstrate how to replicate the simulation results in our paper.
